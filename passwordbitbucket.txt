how to create password bitbucket vscode macos
ChatGPT said:
Gotcha 👍 On Bitbucket you don’t create a “password” 
inside VS Code. On macOS (and everywhere else), 
you create an App Password on Bitbucket,
 then use it in VS Code when Git asks for credentials.

Here’s the clean, step-by-step way 👇

1️⃣ Create an App Password on Bitbucket
(Bitbucket no longer accepts your normal account password for Git)

Go to bitbucket.org and log in

Click your profile picture (top right)
Personal settings → App passwords
Click Create app password
Give it a name (e.g. VSCode-Mac)
Permissions (minimum recommended):

✅ Repositories → Read

✅ Repositories → Write

Click Create

COPY THE PASSWORD NOW 🔐

You won’t be able to see it again

2️⃣ Use it in VS Code (macOS)
Option A: When Git prompts you (recommended)
In VS Code terminal:

git push
When asked:

Username → your Bitbucket username

Password → the App Password (not your Bitbucket login password)

VS Code/macOS Keychain will save it automatically.

Option B: Set remote with HTTPS (if not already)
Check your remote:

git remote -v
If needed, set it:

git remote set-url origin https://bitbucket.org/USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
Then push again:

git push -u origin main
3️⃣ (macOS) Clear wrong saved credentials if it fails
If you entered the wrong password before:

Open Keychain Access

Search for bitbucket

Delete any Bitbucket-related entries

Retry git push

❗ Important reminders
❌ Do not use your Bitbucket account password

✅ Always use App Password

✅ Username = Bitbucket username

✅ Password = App Password

If you want, tell me:

are you using HTTPS or SSH?

what exact error message you’re seeing?
