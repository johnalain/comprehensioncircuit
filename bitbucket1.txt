Yep — this is a classic Bitbucket authentication gotcha, and your error message actually gives us a big hint 👇

What’s going wrong
Bitbucket does NOT accept your normal account password for Git anymore.

So when you do this:

Username: john_alain123
Password: (your Bitbucket login password)
👉 Bitbucket rejects it → Authentication failed

That’s why you see:

You may not have access to this repository or it no longer exists

Even if the repo does exist, authentication fails first.

✅ The correct fix (Bitbucket App Password)
You must use an App Password instead of your normal password.

Step 1: Create an App Password
Go to Bitbucket → Personal settings

Click App passwords

Click Create app password

Give it a name (e.g. vscode-git)

Enable permissions:

✅ Repositories: Read

✅ Repositories: Write

Click Create

COPY the password immediately (you won’t see it again)

Step 2: Use it in Git
Now retry your command (git push, git pull, or git clone):

Username: john_alain123
Password: <PASTE APP PASSWORD HERE>
⚠️ Important:

Username = Bitbucket username

Password = App password, NOT your Bitbucket login password

🧹 If Git keeps using the wrong password (macOS)
macOS often saves the wrong credentials in Keychain.

Run this once:

git config --global --unset credential.helper
Or remove Bitbucket credentials manually:

Open Keychain Access

Search for bitbucket

Delete related entries

Try again

🔍 Also double-check these
Make sure:

The repo really exists:
👉 https://bitbucket.org/john_alain123/edurepo

You are the owner or a collaborator

Repo name spelling is exact

✅ Recommended (best practice)
Instead of HTTPS passwords, switch to SSH keys — no passwords, no prompts, much smoother with VS Code on macOS.

If you want, I can:

🔐 Set up SSH for Bitbucket

🧪 Verify repo access

🧹 Fix cached credentials step-by-step
