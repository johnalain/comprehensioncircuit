ChatGPT said:
Yep — this error is classic Bitbucket auth pain, you’re not alone 😅
Let’s fix it step by step.

What’s going wrong (in plain English)
Bitbucket no longer accepts your normal account password for Git

When Git asks for a “Password”, Bitbucket expects an App Password, not your login password.

OR the repository URL is wrong / you don’t have access

This part is suspicious 👇

edurepo1/src/main/
That should NOT be in a git remote URL.

Step 1: Check your remote URL (very important)
Run this:

git remote -v
If you see something like:

https://bitbucket.org/john_alain123/edurepo1/src/main/
❌ That is WRONG.

Fix it
The correct format is:

https://bitbucket.org/<username>/<repo>.git
So set it again:

git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://bitbucket.org/john_alain123/edurepo1.git
Verify:

git remote -v
Step 2: Create a Bitbucket App Password (required)
Go to Bitbucket → Personal settings

Open App passwords

Click Create app password

Give it a name (e.g. vscode-git)

Enable permissions:

✅ Repository → Read

✅ Repository → Write

Click Create

COPY IT NOW (you won’t see it again)

Step 3: Push again (use App Password)
git push -u origin main
When prompted:

Username: john_alain123

Password: 👉 PASTE THE APP PASSWORD (not your Bitbucket login password)

Step 4 (Recommended): Cache credentials on macOS
So it stops asking every time:

git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
If it STILL fails
Check these:

✔️ Repository exists on Bitbucket

✔️ You are the owner or have write access

✔️ Branch is really called main:

git branch
If you want, paste the output of:

git remote -v
and I’ll spot the issue instantly 👀

how to find bitbucket password macos 
ChatGPT said:
Short answer (and I’ll be straight with you):
👉 You cannot “find” your Bitbucket password.

Bitbucket does not allow viewing passwords, and for Git on macOS you should not use your account password anyway.

But here’s what you actually want on macOS 👇

✅ The correct way (what Bitbucket expects)
Bitbucket uses App Passwords for Git
Not your login password. Ever.

So instead of trying to find a password, you create a new one.

🔐 How to create a Bitbucket App Password
Open Bitbucket in your browser

Click your avatar (bottom-left)

Personal settings

App passwords

Click Create app password

Name it (example: macos-git)

Enable:

✅ Repository → Read

✅ Repository → Write

Click Create

COPY IT IMMEDIATELY (you cannot see it again)

👉 This is the “password” Git wants.

🍎 macOS: Check if an old password is saved (optional)
If Git keeps failing, macOS may be auto-using a wrong cached password.

Delete old Bitbucket credentials
Open Keychain Access

Search for:

bitbucket.org
Delete:

Internet password entries for Bitbucket

Then try pushing again — macOS will ask for credentials and you can paste the App Password.

🚀 Push again
git push -u origin main
When asked:

Username: your Bitbucket username

Password: 🔑 App password (not login password)

⚠️ Important takeaway
❌ You cannot retrieve a Bitbucket password

❌ Do not use your Bitbucket login password for Git

✅ Use App Passwords

✅ macOS stores them in Keychain

If you want, tell me:

git remote -v
and I’ll double-check your URL so this doesn’t bite you again 👍

give a message to use api token instead of app password wihich one to use when push
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a clear, copy-paste friendly message you can use 👇

Message:

⚠️ Bitbucket does not accept account passwords for Git operations.
When pushing (git push) over HTTPS, use a Bitbucket App Password (API token) instead of your login password.

Username: your Bitbucket username
Password: App Password / API Token

App Passwords act as API tokens and are the only valid credentials for Git push/pull.

Short version (even simpler)
Use your Bitbucket App Password (API token) as the password when pushing to a repository.
Your normal Bitbucket login password will not work.

If you want it more technical, more beginner-friendly, or as a terminal error hint, tell me and I’ll tailor it 👍
