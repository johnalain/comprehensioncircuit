ChatGPT said:
Ah, yeah — that error is a classic Git gotcha. You’re using a web page URL, not a Git repository URL.

What’s going wrong
This part is the problem 👇

https://bitbucket.org/john_alain123/edurepo/branches/?sort=-name/
That’s a browser link to the branches page, not something Git can clone or push to. Git needs the repo root URL, ending in .git (or without /branches/...).

✅ Correct Bitbucket repository URL
Use one of these instead:

HTTPS

https://bitbucket.org/john_alain123/edurepo.git
SSH (if you use SSH keys)

git@bitbucket.org:john_alain123/edurepo.git
Fix it step by step
From inside your project folder:

git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://bitbucket.org/john_alain123/edurepo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
If it STILL says “Not Found”
One of these is true:

❌ The repo doesn’t exist

❌ The repo is private and you’re not logged in

❌ The username or repo name is wrong

❌ You don’t have write permission

👉 Quick check: open this in your browser while logged in to Bitbucket

https://bitbucket.org/john_alain123/edurepo
If it 404s in the browser, Git won’t find it either.

If you want, tell me:

did you create the repo yourself?

are you using HTTPS or SSH?

what does git remote -v show?

We’ll nail it in one shot 👍

You said:
➜  bitbukectrepo git:(main) git remote add origin https://bitbucket.org/john_alain123/edurepo.git

error: remote origin already exists.
ChatGPT said:
All good — Git is just saying “origin is already there” 👍
Now we just need to fix or replace it, not add it again.

🔍 Step 1: See what origin is currently set to
Run:

git remote -v
You’ll probably see the wrong URL (the /branches/... one).

✅ Option A (recommended): Change the existing origin URL
This is the cleanest fix:

git remote set-url origin https://bitbucket.org/john_alain123/edurepo.git
Verify:

git remote -v
🚀 Step 2: Push your branch
git push -u origin main
❌ Option B (alternative): Remove & re-add origin
Only if you prefer a reset:

git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://bitbucket.org/john_alain123/edurepo.git
git push -u origin main
If you get authentication errors
Bitbucket does NOT accept passwords anymore.

For HTTPS you must use an App Password:

Bitbucket → Personal settings → App passwords

Give repo permissions

Use it instead of your password when Git asks

Still stuck?
Paste the output of:

git remote -v
git branch
We’re very close — this is the last mile 💪

You said:
Password for 'https://john_alain123@bitbucket.org': 
remote: You may not have access to this repository or it no longer exists in this workspace. If you think this repository exists and you have access, make sure you are authenticated.
ChatGPT said:
Yep — this message is 100% expected if you’re entering your Bitbucket account password. Bitbucket rejects normal passwords for Git over HTTPS.

You’re almost there. Here’s the exact fix 👇

✅ The REAL solution (HTTPS): use an App Password
Step 1: Create an App Password
Log in to Bitbucket

Click your avatar (bottom-left) → Personal settings

        Go to App passwords

        Click Create app password

        Give it a name (e.g. git-mac)

        Permissions (important):

✅ Repository → Read

✅ Repository → Write

Click Create

COPY the password (you won’t see it again)

Step 2: Push again
git push -u origin main
When it asks:

Username: john_alain123
Password: <PASTE APP PASSWORD HERE>
⚠️ Do NOT use your Bitbucket login password.

✅ Optional (recommended): save credentials
To avoid typing it every time:

git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
macOS will store it securely.

🔁 Alternative (cleaner): switch to SSH (no passwords)
If you want, I can walk you through:

git remote set-url origin git@bitbucket.org:john_alain123/edurepo.git
(one-time SSH key setup, then zero prompts forever)

🚨 If it STILL says no access
Double-check:

You are logged in as john_alain123

The repo exists at
https://bitbucket.org/john_alain123/edurepo

The repo is not under a team/workspace you don’t own

If you want, tell me:

did you create this repo yourself?

is it under your account or a workspace?

do you want HTTPS or SSH?

We’ll finish this cleanly 👌
